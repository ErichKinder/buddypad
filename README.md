# buddypad

The buddypad is an attempt to fill the missing keys that many split ergo keyboards have, the F-keys, a keypad, the print screen cluster, and arrow keys.

The buddypad is designed to live between the halves of a split ergo keyboard, have all the components be either easily sourced or 3d printed in an FDM printer, while still being small enough that the PCBs are not overly expensive.
